# Description 
I want to make a short zelda 1 inspired game where you go around in a top down perspective attacking enemies with dungeons and secrets


# Features 
I want the mini game to be top down perspective and include a few different weapons (some with projectils) and some unique items such as bombs that would open up secrets. I want to include at the VERY LEAST one dungeon and at least 3 different kinds of enemies that scale on health and damage. I would like to track health and item count so that your character isn't immortal and include a few secrets on the map that reveal items or maybe a secret boss

# Challenges 
To be honest, I have NO IDEA how I want to do this. While listing items and health shouldn't be too hard what I'm concerned about is the whole gameplay and dungeon aspect. I'm worried about not being able to make different kinds of environments even as simple as Zelda 1 was. I might have to do my own research into how to do different environments. 

# Outcomes 
A. The ideal outcome is to accomplish everything I've set out to do and a bit more. I want to add some extra sweets and secrets so that the game is a bit replayable and maybe add an npc or two to help around with how to find these secrets compared to something like zelda 1.

B. The minimum variable outcome would be to at LEAST make the inventory/health system work as well as the ability to at least fight enemies and move around a map.

# Milestones 
With each passing week I want to accomplish more and more. At first I want to get the map done. This way I will be able to work on a character and thats what I want to get done at first. After that I want to work on combat and environmental puzzles. ONCE I have that done I want to get to adding all of the extra stuff, like stronger enemies, weapons, and secrets.
